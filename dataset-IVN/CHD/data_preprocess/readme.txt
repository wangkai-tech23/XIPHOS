You can generate the edge files required for training through our "GCL edges attack 50_40.py" and "GCL edges normal 50_40.py", which include three parts: graph property generation, data slice and data movement.

You can generate the node vector files required for training through our "GCL nodes attack 50_40.py" and "GCL nodes normal 50_40.py", which include three parts: graph property generation, data slice and data movement.

You can get the node vector files after batch data merging through our "GCL merge node vectors 50_40.py".
