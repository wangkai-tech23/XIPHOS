XIPHOS is a graph contrast learning-based in-vehicle unsupervised intrusion detection method . With high-performance operation efficiency, StatGraph is well adapted to the vehicle environment and protects the security of the in-vehicle CAN bus.

You can see the details in our paper Adaptive In-Vehicle Intrusion Detection via Unsupervised Graph Contrast Learning.

We provide four folders: the "Baseline-models" for unsupervised baseline models, the "dataset-IVN" folder for the preprossed data, the "GCL-master" folder and the "DHC-master" folder for the  graph contrast learning code and the dynamic hierarchical classification inference model code.

The code for other baseline methods mentioned in our paper can be found in https://github.com/wangkai-tech23/StatGraph.
